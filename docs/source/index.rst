TensorState's Documentation
=======================================

Introduction
------------

TensorState is a toolbox designed to analyze the way neural networks
process information to calculate metrics about the network architecture.

Both Tensorflow and PyTorch are supported, but complex networks may prove
problematic for some of the network functions (such as automatically building an
efficiency model). Let us know if you run into problems.
