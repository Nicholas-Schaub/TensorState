TensorState's Documentation
=======================================

Introduction
------------

TensorState is a toolbox designed to analyze the way neural networks
process information.

Both Tensorflow and PyTorch are supported, but complex networks may prove
problematic for some of the network functions (such as automatically building an
efficiency model).

For comments, suggestions, and bug reports, open an issue on
`Github <https://github.com/Nicholas-Schaub/tensorstate/issues>`_.
